State Table
"""""""""""
The next step is to detect whether the LEDs shown in the ROIs are powered on or off and in addition if they are on the
color can be determined. The so gained information will be saved in the state_table which contains a list of
StateEntries:

.. list-table:: State_Entry
    :header-rows: 1

    * - name
      - current_state
      - last_time_on
      - last_time_off
      - hertz
    * - String
      - LEDState
      - Timestamp
      - Timestamp
      - Float

The frequency saved in the attribute 'hertz' will be calculated by the detector when the first change between on and off
occurs.
Changes of the table will then be forwarded to MQTT.
