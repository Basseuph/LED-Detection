General approach
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Based on the reference image, features are extracted with SIFT and matched with 'knn nearest' in the target image.
The matching allows to calculate the homography matrix which describes the rotation and scaling difference between the
reference and target image. With the difference known, it is possible to calculate relative coordinates from the reference
into absolut coordinates in the target image. Consequently, the coordinates of the LEDs can be calculated and
regions of interest (ROI) can be extracted.

    An example for a reference picture of a Raspberry Pi model B+
    The image shows the board from above and is cropped to the corner points of the board. Such reference data can be
    generated with the BDG and is necessary for providing the state of the board in a target image.
