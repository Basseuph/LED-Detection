Homoegraphy Pipeline
====================

The homography pipeline provides an homography matrix for estimating the transformation between two images.
With this matrix, it is possible to calculate the locations of the led coordinates in the second image
with the prior knowledge of the location of the leds in the reference image.
Consider the following example:

Given the coordinates of the leds in the reference image.
.. math::
    X_1 = \begin{pmatrix} x_1 \\ y_1 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}

This chapter describes how the homography pipeline works in detail.
